<p>Pyrography is an art where you decorate wood or leather by burning it. I learned about it when I went on a girl scout camping trip. My mother brought the tool and I fell in love with it instantly. Since then I have enjoyed pyrography. Later I began burning cedar because of it's nice pink color and the scent when it burns is wonderful.</p> 
    <p>There are some problems with the art of pyrography like:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Smoke in your eyes and nose</li>
        <li>Constantly burning yourself</li>
        <li>Spinters in your fingers</li>
        <li>Wood shreddings in your eyes</li>
    </ol>
<p>These are just some of the consequences of wood burning or pyrography. Even though some may say that this is dangerous I think it's fun and completly worth the burns. Nothing beats the feeling of completing a new peice.</p>
